# This repository is for a demo for social authentication using OAuth2.0

You will need to run the backend server in order to test this project

# You can only register with one provider, so if you have already with same email you will get an error

### To run this client you will need to the package `serve`
```bash
serve -p 3000
```

The callback URL for the client is `http://localhost:3000/auth-callback?provider={provider}`

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, or need help with this project.
